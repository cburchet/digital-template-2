<h2>2 player Breakout</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Player vs computer game of breakout with multiple levels increasing in difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The feeling of competition against the computer as they try to beat it as well as competition against friends as they try to reach the highest level possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade style game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the mouse to move the paddle to bounce the ball back at the opponent and eliminate all of their bricks. One of the aspects of gameplay that I did not get to implementing would be power ups for the ball to access such as temporary increase in speed, massive curve, etc.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Two players playing breakout with one of the players being controlled by the computer. Multiple levels can be played with a better computer and more bricks to destroy.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
2 players including a computer player.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Just two people playing breakout against each other
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
NA
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Competitive players
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
A few minutes perhaps longer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Bouncing the ball at a curve (not hitting the ball in the center of the paddle) will likely be the best way to score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing from a Phaser Example, you must say so here.
